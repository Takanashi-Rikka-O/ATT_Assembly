IA-32 CPU Enviornmention : 

IA-32 : Intel Pentium CPU 32bit Framework (8086-16bit,80386-32bit).
CPU primary parts : 
	1>	Controload unit.
	2>	Process unit.
	3>	Registers.
	4>	Flags.
							<--->	Registers
	Work method : 	Controload-unit <---> Process-unit
							<--->	Flags

	Controload-Unit Features : 
		1>	Get instructions from memory.
		2>	Decode instruction for process it.
		3>	Get necessary data from memory (CPU save these data into registers).
		4>	If necessity then save result.
		
		#	IA-32 CPU use the technology called 'NetBurst-Controload-Unit' to adjustment for process speed.
		Features of NetBurst :
			1>	Instruction read and decode in advance.
				- Instructions prefetch>
					Using pipeline to realizate prefetch,so must build cache memory in CPU.The speed of CPU access to cache-memory is 
				faster than other memory.It is called L1-cache.But program is possable to do jump-operation,at the situation,CPU must clear
				cache-memory before next prefetch.So introduce L2 cache-memory for adjustment process speed.L1 is independent with L2,if 
				process do jump-operation,L1 clear and then read new instructions but L2 still save the old instructions.Afters new part have
				finished,CPU read L2 to process instructions is older L1.
					
			2>	Branch prediction.
				- Prediction technology>
					1. Deeper prediction.(Allowed CPU to decode instructions across a lot of branch)
					2. Dynamic data stream analyse.(Analysing stream with statistics)
					3. Reasoning process.(Allowed CPU to confirms that whether the far instructions would be processing,and try to 
					treatme	nt them )

			3>	No order to process.
				- None-order-processing-engine>
					Analyse data from prefetch/decode pipeline and resort them.The engine could processing these instructions before
				them would have to process.
				- Parts>
					1. Distributor.(Respone to buffer distribute,if the resources is too less,would be stopping instructions treatment 
					and distribute resource to a other instruction it could be finished.)

					2. Registers rename.(Distribute logic registers to treatment the instructions which must use register.)
					3. Micro-operation dispatcher.(Send the micro-operation to Retire-unit,and at same time to keep synchronize.

			4>	Retire.(Receives all micro-operation them had been sent by pipeline and adjustment order to normally order.

	Process-Unit Features :
		Built by a Arithmetic-Logic-Unit or  more than one.Them respones to some math operations.
		Pentium 4 Independent ALU :
				1. Simple integer operation.
				2. Complex integer operation.
				3. Float operation.

	Registers : 
		Classic : 

			Normal registers	--	Eight for 32bit registers,use them to save data now processing.
			Segment registers	--	Six for 16bit registers,use them to access to memory.
			Instruction pointer	--	Unique 32bit register and it point to next instruction.
			Float data registers	--	Eight for float registers all are 80bit.
			Control			--	Five for 32bit registers to confirms CPU operation mode.
			Debug			--	Eight for 32bit registers,used to save information in debug.

		Normal Registers : 
	
			EAX	--	Accumulator for operand or result.
			EBX	--	A pointer to point data in data-memory-segment.
			ECX	--	Counter for string or cycle operation.
			EDX	--	I/O pointer.
			EDI	--	String operation destination pointer.
			ESI	--	String operation source pointer.
			ESP	--	Stack pointer.
			EBP	--	Stack data pointer.

			#	Register EAX,EBX,ECX,EDX could be splited to 16bit register or 8bit registers.
			#	EAX--> AX(16bit),AH(Hight 8bit)/AL(Low 8bit);
			#	EBX--> BX(16bit),BH(Hight 8bit)/BL(Low 8bit);
			#	ECX--> CX(16bit),CH(Hight 8bit)/CL(Low 8bit);
			#	EDX--> DX(16bit),DH(Hight 8bit)/DL(Low 8bit);

		Segment registers : 

			Memory mode : 
				1> Flat memory mode.(All system memory as a continuous address space [linear address] )
				2> Segments memory mode.(Divide memory to some indenpendent memory section,use segment registers to cite them)

					CS	--	Code section.
					DS	--	Data section.
					SS	--	Stack section.
					ES	--	Additional section pointer.
					FS	--	Additional section pointer.
					GS	--	Additional section pointer.

				#	All segment registers are 16bit,save the start address of the specify section.

				3> Realy address memory mode.(All segment registers point to zero-linear-address,and could not changed by program)

		Instruction pointer register : 
		
			EIP,Instruction pointer.It was called 'Program Counter' in the sometimes.It point to next instruction which would be processing.
		You can not change it directly,you may to use some instructions to change it.
			In 'Flat memory mode' it point to linear-address,in 'Segment memory mode' it point to logic-address and ust 'CS' to access memory.

		Controload registers :
		
			CR0	--	Controload operation mode and system flags.
			CR1	--	Not be usage yet.
			CR2	--	Memory page error information.
			CR3	--	Memory page menu information.
			CR4	--	Flags to support CPU charcteristic and explain it.

			#	Could not access to control registers directly,but could to send data in it to the normal registers.So program could check 
			#	situation of CPU or processing work currently.

	Flags : 
		Classic : 
		
			Status flags.

	IA-32 Advance Characteristic : 

		1>	Floating-point-unit (FPU).
		2>	Multimedia-extension (MMX).
		3>	Streaming SIMD extension,SSE.
		4>	Hyberthreading.

		FPU :
			This feature for deal with float data as faster to be designed.Start on 80486,80287,80387 CPU,advance calculation had been integrated
		to Main-Processor,so that support these features need addend some registers and processing units.These elements as a piece called 'x87 Float-
		-ing point unit'(FPU)

			Registers :
				
				FPU-Reg				Description

				Data-Register			Usage of float data processing 80bit-register total is eight.
				
				Status-Register			Report status of FPU 16bit register.
	
				Control-Register		Control for FPU precision 16bit register.

				Mark-Register			Descripte to content in data-registers 16bit register.

				FIP-Register			Point to next FPU instruction 48bit pointer.

				FDP-Register			Point to data in memory 48bit pointer.

				Operand-Register		Save the lastest FPU instruction which had been processed 11bit register.

		MMX :

			'Multimedia extension' was designed for support to 'Single Instruction,Multiple Data,SIMD'.

			MMX enviornment have three new data type of integer : 

				64bit packing byte integer.
				64bit packing word integer.
				64bit packing double-words integer.

		SSE : 

			Power up floating performance of  '3DGraph' and 'Dynamic video' and 'Video task'.

		 these new features,and SSE had introduced new addend instructions as well.
			Pentium4 (SSE2) introduced five new data type : 

				128bit packing double-precision float data.
				128bit packing byte integer.
				128bit packing word integer.
				128bit packing double-words integer.
				128bit packing four-words integer.

		Hyberthreading : 

			This feature make IA-32 CPU could processing multi-processes at same time.Advantage would indicating on multi-task OS.


	#	When you are programming assembly program,you should understand some informations of destination CPU.

##	System Mode :

		Intel processor : 8080,8086/8088,80186,80286,80386,80486,Pentium,PentiumII,PentiumIII,Pentium4...

		Realy-mode : 

			Such as 8086/8088,them could not support to mulit-tasks-OS.
			In this mode,address-space is as same as hardware memory number.Programs could access to physics address,and change data in it.
		
		Protect-mode : 
			
			Support to multi-tasks-work-method.All programs could only access to virtual address,exclusive of kernel.
			For example,after 80386...(include 80386).

		Virtual-8086-mode : 
			
			Switch work mode from 'protect mode' to '8086 work mode'.For example,the DOS-window of windowsOS.

##	Cardinality And Complement Code

	Cardinality convertion :

			Number - 128	

			Dec:	128
			Ocx:	0200
			Hex:	0xF0

			Binary:	10000000

		For OCX,'0' is prefix;for HEX,'0x' is prefix.
		Three binary bits convert to a OCX bit,four binary bits convert to a HEX bit.
		
		Value scope : 

		Dec: 0---9
		Ocx: 0---7
		Hex: 0---F (10-A,11-B,12-C,13-D,14-E,15-F)
		Bin: 0---1

		Numbering for binary bits,right to left : '7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0'.
		Binary transinformation to Dec: (Such as 128)
			128=0*2^0 + 0*2^1 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^3 + 0*2^4 + 0*2^5 + 0*2^6 + 1*2^7

	Complement code : 

		For normaly situation use '1 complement-code'.Use the highest bit to indicate '+' or '-'.0--'+',1--'-'.
		Flip all binary bits and then adding '1' to get a 'Negative number' of the value.
		E.g.
			+128 - 10000000	(Positive)
			-128 - 
				A:	01111111 (~+128)
				B:	01111111+1
				C:	10000000 (Negative)

			+83 - 01010011 (Positive)
			-83 -
				A:	10101100 (~+83)
				B:	10101100+1
				C:	10101101 (Negative)

Assembly Language Translater :

		For another platform have some another assembly translaters.

		Windows : 
			MASM (Microsoft Assembler)	--	Intel syntax assembly.

		Linux :
			GAS (GNU Assembler)		--	AT&T syntax assembly.
			#	This program as a background assembler for GCC to be designed.
	
		Windows/Linux :
			NASM （Newwide Assembler,NASM)	--	Intel syntax or AT&T syntax.
	
			HLA (High Levle Assembler,HLA)	--	Intel syntax.

		Linker :
			
			On the linux,could use 'ld' to make execution file.
	
		Debuger :
			
			On the linux,could use 'GNU/gdb' to debug program.
			Use 'GNU/objdump' to checking bottom-floor instructions.
			Use 'GNU/gprof' to analysing for program code.

AT&T Assembly basic explanation :

		First : The building for program>

		#	In the OS 'GNU/Linux',parts'distribution of program is like this : 

			-----

			Stack	--->	Stack section,ESP point to the top of this stack in program.(Because linux use page/vm to mapping for memory,so in 
					SS a filedescription was saved in it.)
			-----

			Unmap	--->	When linux load a program will make it a illsion that it have a large memory space.But if program want to using for 
					these memory,must call 'brt' to map physics for them.
			-----
			data	--->	'data' section is saving some value(variables) them has been initialized.
			-----
			bss	--->	'bss' section is saving some value(variables) use 'null' or '0' to initialize them.So it always used to as buffer.
			-----
			text	--->	'text' section is saving program code by binary type with read only.
			-----

		Second : The general assembly program with AT&T>

		#
			.section .data		#	Declare '.data' section.
					...
			.section .bss		#	Declare '.bss' section.
					...
			.section .text		#	Declare '.text' section.
			.global _start		#	Declare that the symbol '_start' is a global symbol,it was needed by 'ld'.

				_start:		#	The program startion.
					...
		#

			These in over all are not instructions,them are Assembler-commands.These is additional inforamtions would be sent to translater.
			
			'.section' -> Define a section.
			'.global' -> Define a global symbol.
			'_start:' -> A symbol.'linker' will use this symbol to set up for execulation-file'start-pointer.

			What is symbol?
			Answer: 
				Symbol is a lable,it is not instruction.If only be processed by translater,translater use it to mark a memory address.
			So that means a symbol is a address mark or is a address.In program could use symbol to represent a address value.
				The style of symbol : 
					Use ' . || _ || [A-Z] || [a-z] || ? ' as head,use a ':' as end.':' means that the signal is a lable.
				E.g. MSG: (This is a symbol).
			#	Remember,symbol is a address.

		#	
			Commands of Assembler>
				For anthoer assemblers them have some commands all as not same,the command is not a instruction,commands only be processed by
			Assembler.Assembler use them to processing for some works.
				'.section' and '.global' are commands.

		Third : The AT&T assembly syntax>
	
		#	Parts : 
				1> Optional instruction prefix.
				2> Operation code(opcode).
				3> Optional modifier.
				4> Optional data element.

			The basic layout : 
				
				| I-prefix | Opcode | Modifier(ModR/M) | SIB | Displacement | Data element |
				
			Size of them : 
				I-prefix -- 0~4 Byte.
				Opcode -- 1~3 Byte.
				ModR -- 0~1 Byte.
				SIB -- 0~1 Byte.
				Displacement -- 0~4 Byte.
				Data element -- 0~4 Byte.
			
			1> Opcode : 
				In assembly the Opcode is only for needed,another Opcode have another feature.
			2> I-prefix : 
				The prefix features class : 
					1.	Lock-prefix and Repeat-prefix.
					#	Lock-prefix indicate to the instruction would lock up share memory zone.
					#	Repeat-prefix always used to repeat instruction operation.
			
					2.	Section-override-prefix and Branch-prompt-prefix.
					#	Section-override-prefix could cover to the instruction has been defined segment-register.
					#	Branch-prompt-prefix try to provides the condition-jump-path-clue is possible.
	
					3.	Operand-Length-Cover-Prefix.
					#	Notice to processor that program would be switching this Opcode between in 16bit and 32bit.

					4.	Address-Length-Cover-Prefix.
					#	Notice to processor that program would be switching address-type between in 16bit and 32bit.
			3>ModR : 
				Some Opcodes needs modifier for understant the registers and memory-position was involed by this usage.
			Modifier was contained in three for values indenpendy.

			#	Modifier(ModR/M) -- Address accessing mode explanation.
			#	SIB -- Scale-Index-Base_Address.
			#	Address_Displacement -- one or two or four for address displacement Byte.

				ModR/M> (Three fields)
					Mod | Reg/Opcode | r/m
	
				ModR : 2Bits.It always using with 'r/m'.Them defined register or address-accessing-mode in the Opcode.In Opcode,possible 
			address-accessing-mode have 24 kinds,adding the eight for registers,so all the values have 32 kinds probably.
				
				Reg/Opcode : 3Bits.Allowed to use the 3bits to defined Opcode feature or defined register-value further.

				r/m : 3Bits.Defined the other one register for currented Opcode,or combining with the ModR field to defined a Opcode address-
			-accessing-mode.

				---
		
				SIB> (Three fields)
					Scale | Index | Base_Address
				
				Scale : 2Bits.It is the scale_value of the specify Opcode.
				Index : 3Bits.It specified to a register it would as the Index-Register.
				Base_Address : 3Bits.It specified to a register it would as the Base_Address-Register.

				---

				Address_Displacement>
					It as the index-value for the Memory-Address defined by ModR/M and SIB.Could use it as the Base_Memory_Address.

				---

			4>Data element : 
				The Opcode'Operand.Some Opcode need a data-element as operation destination,so them could read data-element from registers or
			from memory-position.This 'Value' could contain four for Bytes info.

			##

		#	Assembly use these bits build some 'Mnemonic' like these : 
			
			mov	$0x32,%EAX	//	Move(Send) 0x32 to register EAX.
			push	%EAX		//	Push the element in EAX to stack.
			pop	%EBX		//	Pop the top element in stack to EAX.
			iaddl	$-20,%EAX	//	Signed adding,EAX=%EAX+(-20);this Opcode'operand length is double-words(l,4B).
			sub	$2,%EAX		//	None signed division,EAX=%EAX-2;this Opcode'operand leght would be auto to matching by translater.
			
		---

		Fourth : The data types defined by GNU-Assembler>

			Commands			Type

			.ascii				text string
			.asciz				text string use a '\0' as end
			.byte				a value length is one byte
			.double				double precision floating data
			.float				single precision floating data
			.int				32bit integer
			.long				32bit integer
			.octa				sixteen bytes integer
			.quad				quad bytes integer
			.short				16bit integer
			.single				single precision floating data

		# Remember : 
			These types all were defined by assembler,but in memory,them only is some memory unit(1B/Unit).
		For the '.int',assembler would open a 4Bytes space up,that is the four for memory units and them are continuous.All types only is some memory
		units,and 'one unit have 8bit length'!The memory units all are save some binary datas.You could understand to the type like that open some 
		memory space up.

			For example : 
			
				MSG:
					.ascii "Hello World"
			##
				'MSG:' -- It is a symbol which is a memory address.
				'.ascii' -- Data type 'text string'.
				"..." -- GAS interprets the context in '"' as a ASCII string.

			Static value symbol : 
			
				Command : '.equ'
	
				For example : .equ Name,Value

				#	Name is a symbol,Value is the const value.Then you could cite it in '.text' with a '$'.
				#	Like this : $Name

		# bss section data type : 

			Commands	Description

			.comm		Declare normaly memory zone for uninitialized-data.
			.lcomm		Declare locale normaly memory zone for uninitialized-data.

			Syntax : 
				.comm(.lcomm) symbol,length

			.comm type could be accessing by others external programs.
			.lcomm type could not be accessing by others external programs.

			The space size is length would be fulled by translater with '0'.

		---

		Fiveth : Data and Address accessing and Registers cite>

			Immediate number : 
					'ImmN' always would as the Immediate number used in the instrcutions.
			'11','0x11','012','0B00001111' and more all are 'Immediate numbers',in AT&T,if you want use a ImmN in a instruction,must to adding a 
		prefix '$'.Like this : $0x12,$12,$033,$0B10010011 ...

			Address accessing : 
					Address accessing is that use a memory address unit in a instruction to I/O data.
				AT&T use 'indexed memory mode' to accessing for memory address unit.
			
				# Indexed memory mode >
					The memory address have be determinded by these items : 
					
					#	Base_Address
					#	The displacement of Base_Address
					#	Data element length
					#	Index_Address to Determinding for the element

				The general expression style : section:displacement(Base,Index.Scale)
				But Linux working on the Protect method,exclution for kernel programs all applications could only seen logic linear address.
			So could not use the segment registers in that expression.
				The calculation method : 
						The-real-address=Section_Reg*16+Base_Addres+Index*Scale+Displacement ;
					
				Because the protect working mode,so use Base_Address,Index_Address,Scale,Displacement to accessing address.

			Base_Address and Index_Address could is anyregister which is 32bit.
			Scale could is the value 1,2,4,8.
			Displacement is the Dec'Positive or Negative number.
			And the Base_Addres and Index_Addres could only use ones of them,but at that situation,you must use ',' as 'Placeholder' yet.The 
		Scale default is '1'.

			According for the narration,the general usage like these : 

				#	12(%EBX,%ESI,0x1)
				#	(%EBX,%ESI,0x1)
				#	(,%ESI,0x1)
				#	-3(,%ESI,)
			
			#	Null parts value is 0,exclution 'Scale'

			Absolute addressing : 
					
					M[Imm]		-->		movq	0x600639,%EAX

			Registers cite>

				In AT&T assembly language,cite a Register must adding a prefix '%' in the front of Register-Name.
				#	Like this : 
						%EAX,%EBX,%SS,%CS,%ES...

				#	%Reg -> Get data from Reg which would as operand.
				#	(%Reg) -> Get data from Reg which would as an address to be accessing.

				#	Case insenstive!

		Sixth : The CPUID instruction>

			CPUID is a assembly instruction,use this instruction could requesting for processor information from CPU.CPUID use EAX register as 
		the input register.Send another value to EAX to get another infos.

			EAX-Value			CPUID-Output

			0				Vendor-ID-string and the maxinum CPUID selction
			1				Processor type,serise,model,single-split-info
			2				Processor cache completing info
			3				Processor sequence number
			4				Cache completing(threads number,kernels number,physics attributes)
			5				Surveillance information
			0x80000000			Extended Vendor-ID-string and the supported level
			0x80000001			Extended processor type,serise,model,single-split-info
			0x80000002--0x80000004		Extended the name string or processor

			For example : 
				#	Send 0x0 to EAX and then execute 'CPUID'.The data from returned by CPU.
				
				EBX :		The lowest 4 Bytes.
				ECX :		The midly 4 Bytes.
				EDX :		The highest 4 Bytes.

		Combinations : 
			
			movX	Imm,Reg
			movX	Imm,Mem
			movX	Reg,Reg

		###	Addition

		IaddX	source,destination

		#	source could is ImmN,MemAddr-Data,Reg.
		#	destination could is MemAddr-Data,Reg.
		#	But could not use MemAddr as source and destination at the same time.
		#	Add result would be saved in 'destination'.
		#	'X' could is 'b','w','l','q'(In 64bit model).
		#	'I' could is 'i(Signed)',or is null.

		!	Becareful,'add' would change EFLAGS register.'CF' is 'carry or borrow','OF' is 'overflow'.

		IadcX	source,destination

		#	adcX could processing the values are greater than addX's.Because adcX will use CF-bit to do adding calculate.
		#	source could is 8bit,16bit,32bit Register or MemAddr-Data.
		#	destination could is 8bit,16bit,32bit,Register or MemAddr-Data.
		#	But could not use MemAddr as source and destination at the same time.
		#	'X' could is 'b','w','l','q'.
		#	'I' could is 'i(Signed)',or is null.

			For example to adding two 32bit values : 
				
					#	The value1
					movw	$0xFFFF,%AX	//	High 16bit
					movw	$0xE0BC,%BX	//	Low 16bit
					
					#	The value2
					movw	$0x3012,%CX	//	High 16bit
					movw	$0x1003,%DX	//	Low 16bit

					addw	%BX,%DX		//	Low 16bit + Low 16bit		CF=1.
					adcw	%AX,%CX		//	High 16bit + High 16bit

					Result = CX(Hight 16bit),DX(Low 16bit)

		##	Subtraction

		IsubX	source,destination

		#	source could is 8bit,16bit,32bit,Register or MemAddr-Data.
		#	desitination could is 8bit,16bit,32bit,Register or MemAddr-Data.
		#	Subtraction result would be saved in destination.
		#	'X' could is 'b','w','l','q'.
		#	'I' could is 'i(Signed)'.

		!	Becareful,'add' would change EFLAGS register.'CF' is 'carry or borrow','OF' is 'overflow'.	

		IsbbX	source,destination

		#	This instruction like as IadcX.It will use info from 'CF' bit to do subtract.(Borrow).

			For example to subtract two 32bit values : 

					#	The value1
					movw	$0xABBF,%AX	//	High 16bit
					movw	$0x1002,%BX	//	Low 16bit
			
					#	The value2
					movw	$0x08F2,%CX	//	High 16bit
					movw	$0xF101,%DX	//	Low 16bit

					subw	%DX,%BX		//	Low 16bit - Low 16bit.This will set CF on.
					sbbw	%CX,%AX		//	High 16bit - High 16bit.This will use the CF bit.

					Result=AX(High 16bit),BX(Low 16bit)

		##	Increasing and Decreasing

		IincX	operand		//	operand++

		IdecX	operand		//	operand--

		#	These instructions often be using to None-Signed value.If you use them at Signed value,becareful the symbol'changing.
		#	operand could is 8bit,16bit,32bit,Register or MemAddr-Data.
		#	'I' could is 'i(Signed)' or null.
		#	'X' could is 'b','w','l','q'.

		
		##	Multiplition and division

		ImulX	source

		#	source could is 8bit,16bit,32bit,Register or MemAddr-Data.
		#	The implication value default saved in AL(8bit-mul).

		#	If source == 8bit,the first value in AL;if source == 16bit,the first value in AX;if source == 32bit,the first value in DX--AX(H-L).
		#	So,source and implication-value in multiplition must as same length.

		#	The result:
				8bit-mul	-->	AX
				16bit-mul	-->	DX(high 16bit),AX(low 16bit)
				32bit-mul	-->	EDX(high 32bit),EAX(low 16bit)

		#	'I' could is 'i(Signed)' or null.
		#	'X' could is 'b','w','l','q'.

			###	For signed multiplition.

			imul	source				//	As same as None signed multiplition.
			imul	source,destination		//	destination=source*destination
			imul	multiplier,source,destination	//	destination=source*multiplier(Immediate-Number)

			Becareful,you must prevent calculation overflow when you doing calculate.


		IdivX	source

		#	source could is 8bit,16bit,32bit,Register or MemAddr-Data.
		#	The implication divided value default saved in AX(8bit-div).

		#	If source == 8bit,divided-value must is 16bit in AX;if source == 16bit,divided-value must is 32bit in DX-AX(H-L);if source == 32bit,
		#	divided-value must is 64bit in EDX--EAX(H-L).

		#	The result:
				8bit-div	-->	AX(AL--Quotient_Value,AH--Remain_Value)
				16bit-div	-->	DX--AX(AX--Quotient_Value,DX--Remain_Value)
				32bit-div	-->	EDX--EAX(EAX--Quotient_Value,EDX--Remain_Value)

		#	'I' could is 'i(Signed)' or null.
		#	'X' could is 'b','w','l','q'.

			###	For signed division.

			idiv	source
	
			#	source could is 8bit,16bit,32bit,Register or MemAddr-Data.
			#	Other syntax as same as none-signed division.

	#	Bit operation

		##	Bit Move

		shlX		To left logic move bit.
		salX		To left calculation move bit.
	
		shrX		To right logic move bit.
		sarX		To right calculation move bit.

		Syntax :
			
			shl	destination		-->	The bits in destination move to left with 1bit.
			shl	%CL,destination		-->	The bits in destination move to left with the bit-number in CL.
			shl	shifter,destination	-->	The bits in destination move to left with the bit-number is equal to shifter.

			#	destination could is 8bit,16bit,32bit,Register or MemAddr-Data.
			#	'X' is the length of destination.

			#	The bit had been moved to outside will be saving in 'CF' temporarily(Next bit will cover it).	--	shlX/salX
			#	The new null bit will be fulling by '0'.	--	shlX/salX

			The syntax of shrX and sarX as same as shlX and salX.
		
			#	But for signed value,move bit will cause some problems.
			#	If destination is a none-signed value,that is don't worry,but if it is a signed value,the highest bit is the symbol of 
			#	positive or negative.So,SHRX will clear the null bits in left,and SARX will full older symbol-bit to the highest bit.

		##	Cycle to move bit

		ROLX		To left move bit by cycle.
		RORX		To right move bit by cycle.
		RCLX		To left move bit by cycle with 'Carry-flag' together.
		RCRX		To right move bit by cycle with 'Carry-flag' together.

		The cycle move bit instructions,in the general as same as SHLX/SHRX/SALX/SARX.But them would not drop the overflow-bit,them will be placing 
	the overflow-bit to the other place.(Left to Right,Right to Left).

		Syntax : 
			
			rolX	source			-->	Move 1bit to left.
			rolX	%CL,source		-->	Move ?bits to left.(? is counter in CL-Reg).
			rolX	shifter,source		-->	Move shifter-bits to left.(shifter is a immediate-value).

	---

	#	Logic operation :

			Instructions		(The C programming Language logic operators)

			AND		-->	&
			NOT		-->	~
			OR		-->	|
			XOR		-->	^

			Syntax : 

				AND	source,destination	//	destination&=source
				#	OR and XOR's syntax as same as AND's.

				'source' could is 8bit,16bit,32bit immediated value or register or memory unit.
				'destination' could is 8bit,16bit,32bit register or memory unit.
				#	But can not use memory units at same time.

				NOT	operand			//	operand~=operand

			##

			TEST	source,destination		//	destination&source,and then change some EFLAGS bits.

			#	Not write any data to destination,only use source to testing with the destination.

	---

	#	Stack : 

			Stack is the temporary memory space for program.Program could use some Stack-Instructions to accessing the Stack.CPU use SS Register
		as the Stack-Segment-Register,use ESP/SP as the TOP-Element pointer in the stack.But in linux,the protect working mode could not change Stack
		memory section with manual setting.Because when a program has been starting up,System will auto to distribute some memory space for this 
		process.By the time,SS Register only saved a description of resource.If you changed SS,then Stack-Instruction will accessing other memory 
		space these is not own to currently process,so System will send process with a SIGSEGV(Segmention failed).

			Instructions	

			pushX	source		//	Push a element from the source into stack.

			popX	source		//	Pop a element from stack into the source.

			source could is :
						16bit,32bit Register
						16bit,32bit MemAddr-Data
						16bit Segment Register
						8bit,16bit,32bit Immediate Value

			'X' could is :
					'w','l',q'

			#	The Minimun length of source for Stack-Instructions is 16bit(A word).
			#	And the 'w','l' suffix may be used in 32bit-model only.(Use '.code32' command to notice translater use 32bit-model)

			
			pusha		-->	Push all 16bit normaly registers to stack
			popa		-->	Pop all 16bit normaly registers from stack

			pushad		-->	Push all 32bit normaly registers to stack
			popad		-->	Pop all 32bit normaly registers from stack

			pushf		-->	Push the lower 16bit from EFLAGS-Reg to stack
			popf		-->	Pop the lower 16bit from stack to EFLAGS-Reg
		
			pushfd		-->	Push the 32bit EFLAGS-Reg to stack
			popfd		-->	Pop the 32bit EFLAGS-Reg from stack


			Effective to memory accessing the principles by Intel : 

				1>	As 16Bytes boundary to adjustment for 16bit data.
				2>	Adjustment 32bit data make its base_address is the multiplement of 4.
				3>	Adjustment 64bit data make its base_address is the multiplement of 8.
				4>	Prevent to use a lot of little data for sending,use the only a large data for sending.
				5>	Prevent to use longer data in the Stack.

	#	Jump and Cycle>	

			Before use Jump-Instructions,must understand that How CPU to processing instructions?
			CPU have 'CS'-Segment-Register and 'RIP(64) || EIP(32) || IP(16)'-Instruction-Pointer-Register.

			The 'CS' saved segment address,that is the '.text' section address.The command '.global' declare '_start' symbol as a global symbol.
		And then linker use this symbol to mark start pointer of the ELF file.System load this program,by the time,must initialize some registers at
		before.So 'CS' will be setting up as the address of '.text',and 'IP' will be setting up as '0'.CPU use CS:IP to determind next instruction.
		'IP' saved the next instruction'off_set.CPU at first read instruction to a parts which was called 'Instructions buffer',after that 'IP' will
		increasing the number is equal to the last instruction.At the least,'processing parts' processing the instruction.

			'CS'	--	0x332202
			'IP'	--	0x0
					0x3
					0x5
					0x8
					0xA

			So,'IP' always point to next instruction.
			
			The JUMP-Instructions could change 'CS' or 'IP' to jump the code-place where you want to jump.

			Jump was splited for three kinds :

				1> Shortly Jump

				2> Nearly Jump

				3> Farly Jump

		Shortly Jump'jump-scope is -127~~+128 (Scope of the 'IP' could be changed).
		Nearly Jump'jump-scope is -32768~~+32767 (Scope of the 'IP' could be changed).
		Farly Jump often used to jump to other section.

		#	None condition jump :

			Instructions 

			jmp	location

			call	location

			ret

			int	Int_Num		//	This is an interrupt instruction.

			into	Int_Num		//	This is an intertupt instruction.

			
			#	jmp	location

				On Intel-Assembly,jmp has the syntax : 

					jmp short location
					jmp near ptr location
					jmp far ptr location

				But in AT&T-Assembly,use prefix to change the behaviro : 

					jmp	Location	#	Shortly jump
					ljmp	Section,Offset	#	Long jump

				In the general,Location could is a 'Symbol','Address 0x0000..',or a 32bit Normaly Register.Like this : 
					
					jmp	Temp1	#	Directly jump,Temp1 is a Symbol.
					jmp	0x2211	#	Directly jump,0x2211 is a Relative location.
					jmp	*0x3232	#	Indirectly jump,must adding a '*' in the front.
					jmp	*%EBX	#	Indirectly jump,jump to the location address was saved in EBX.
					jmp	*(%EBX)	#	Indirectly jump,jump to the location address was saved in a Memory-Unit.

				#	Use absolute jump(Indirectly Jump),must have a '*' in the front of address.

				#	%EBX,cite the data in EBX.
				#	(%EBX),cite the data in a Memory-Unit.

					ljmp	%CS,0x33	#	The section long jump.
					ljmp	%DS,0x11	#	Section long jump.
					ljmp	*0x1313		#	Indirectly long jump.

					//	These syntax may be are error instructions,because I have not found long-jump-syntax in the book.

				//	The directly jump,will calculate offset.
				//	The indirectly jump,will use an absolute address.

			#	call	location	And	ret

				'call' instruction often used to call a function.In Assembly,function also is some binary codes in the memory.So could use 
			'call' jump to the 'function' header and processing the function work.At the end of 'Function',process would not auto to return to 
			the 'caller',must use 'ret' instruction initiative to return.
				Like this :

					call	_Division_	#	_Division_ is a symbol

						...

				.type _Division_,@function	#	Notice to assembler that this symbol is a function address.
				_Division_:			#	The function symbol

					....			#	Function feature.

					ret			#	Initiative return.

					'call' do thest work:	(Use assembly language to descripting Assembly-Instruction).

						push	IP		#1,In 64bit linux,will push RIP(8B).
						jmp	Function	#2

					'ret' do thest work:

						pop	IP		#	After IP restore,CPU will processing the next Instruction CS:IP.

						# In 64bit linux,will pop RIP(8B).

				#	And also have long call instruction and long ret instruction.
				
					'lcall' like the 'ljmp'

					long ret is 'lret.

			---

		#	Condition jump : 

				The condition jump instructions all are as same as the jmp instruction,but they would check the EFLAGS before jump.And the 
			condition jump only allows 'Shortly jump' and 'Nearly jump'.

			At first,the 'CMP' instruction.

				CMP	operand1,operand2

			'CMP' instruction compare the two for operands.In the background,'cmp' do the work that 'operand2-operand1' but without change data.
		The result will change the EFLAGS register,and then could use 'Condition Jump' to jump where.

			
			Table of condition jump instructions : 

			Instructions			Description(Jump)		EFLAGS

			JA				above				CF=0 and ZF=0
			JAE				above or equal			CF=0
			JB				below				CF=1
			JBE				below or equal			CF=1 or ZF=1
			JC				'Carry'				CF=1

			JCXZ				CX==0
			JECXZ				ECX==0

			JE				equal				ZF=1
			JG				greater				ZF=0 or SF=OF
			JGE				greater or equal		SF=OF
			JL				less				SF=1 or OF=1
			JLE				less or equal			ZF=1 or SF=1 or OF=1
			JNA				not greater			CF=1 or ZF=1

			#	Cycle

				loop	location
	
				#	loop	location

			
				loop is a shortly jump,and location always is a symbol.Like this :

				loop Cycle

				loop at the first do this work : CX-=1.
				And then if (CX != 0) Jump to symbol,otherwise do not jump.

				Others loop : 

				LOOPE/LOOPZ			Until ECX==0 or have not seted ZF=1.
				LOOPNE/LOOPNZ			Until ECX==0 or have seted ZF=1.

	#	Interrupt>

			Interrupt had been splited to two kinds.
			1>	Can Shield Interrupt.
			2>	Can not Shield Interrupt.

			When CPU finished an instruction once,it would check if got a interrution.The interrupt could is from the internal of CPU,or could is
		from the external of CPU(CMOS,Hardware).System maintain a ‘Interrupt-Vector-Table',the table records all interrupt-program' CS and IP.CPU use
		the 'interrupt kind number' determine to call which interrupt-program.The 'Interrupt-kind-number' always contained in the Interrupt-Message.
			Because the 'Interrupt-Vector-Table' was maintained by System,so must passing System to registration for Custom-Interrupt.
			If IF flag opened,CPU could not to respones the 'Can Shield Interrupt'.But whether IF=1 or IF=0,the 'Can not Shield Interrupt' must 
		be responed by CPU.In 8086CPU,the 'Can not Shield Interrupt' kind number is '2'.

			The Interrupt works of CPU : (int)

				1>	Get kind number
				2>	pushf		(Save PSW)
				3>	IF=0 (TF=0,as the situation to setting up)
				4>	push	CS
				5>	push	IP
				6>	New CS and New Ip

			The return from interrupt-program : (iret)

				1>	pop	IP
				2>	pop	CS
				3>	popf

			Instructions
				
				into	Number
				int	Number		//	Initiativly make a interrupt,'Number' is the interrupt kind number.
				iret			//	Return to the interrupted program from the interrupt-processing-program.

			'int',initiativly make a interrupt,then CPU do the preparation works (All is 6).
			'iret',return to the was interrupted program.

		#	In linux,interrupt process is split for two parts.The up parts and the down parts.Up-parts must finished work as quickly as well,the
		 Down-parts could left and waiting for schedule.And interrput could be interrupted by other one interruption,interruption level spliting.

Assembly Function : 

		Assembly Function have three for steps : 
			1>	Define input parameters.
			2>	Define operation for parameters.
			3>	Define how make the result and how return the result from caller.

		1>	Have three technologies : 
			
			#	Use registers.
			#	Use global variables.
			#	Use Stack.

		2>	Define operation : 
		
			GAS could use commadn '.type' to define a type symbol.
			Use 
				.type Symbol,@function
				Symbol:
					....

			Could define a function.

		3>	Return result : 
			
			#	Save it in the registers.
			#	Save it in a global variable.

		
		When you defining a function,must make some constraint.
		The constraint could contain these : 

				#	The arguments how to send to function.If use Stack,what is the order of pushing?
				#	The result how to return to caller.
				#	Function whether using some registers.

			So could use these constraints to make a enviornment of the function.Like this:

			.type Symbol,@function
			Symbol:

				#	Arguments : Function use Stack to send parametes.(A,B,C...) (Order is A->B->C->...).
				#	Return : Function save result in the EDX register.
				#	Temporarly registers : EAX,EBX,ECX,EDX,EBP.

				Env_Of_Symbol_:

					pushq	%EBP		#	Save EBP
					movq	%ESP,%EBP	#	Use EBP register as Stack accessing pointer.Indirectly accessing.
					pushq	%EAX		#	Save EAX
					pushq	%EBX		#	Save EB
					pushq	%ECX		#	Save ECX
				
					#	EDX would save result.

				Work_Symbol_Zone:

					...
					...

				Return_Symbol_ZOne:

					popq	%ECX	#	Restore the temporarly registers.
					popq	%EBX
					popq	%EAX
					popq	%EBP
	
					ret	#	Return

			And then,could call this function in main code : 

				...		#	Push some parameters to stack.

				call	Symbol	#	Call function.

			Instructions

			call	localtion	#	jump to a new localtion.(Shortly jump)
			lcall	localtion	#	jump to a new localtion.(Long jump)

			ret			#	Return.

			
			The works of 'call' instruction : 

				push IP to stack
				jump to new localtion

			The works of 'ret' instruction : 

				pop IP from stack. (old IP)

		#	Using independent function files : 

			Use independent file as function.o must declare the function-symbol as globally.
			Like this : 

			.type Func,@function
			.global Func		#	Use the command,then other programs could seem this function-symbol.
			Func:
				...

			After use 'ld' link this function.o object could make this function was called by other programs.

Assemly Command-Line Parameters : 

		From shell to execule a process,linux must create a part of the virtual memory space for this process,and the virtual memory space would be 
	mapping to the ahysics memory.For simply finishing this work,all process will got the virtual memory as same,linux use page/logic convertion work to
	convert this virtual memory.
		The virtual memory start on 0x80480000 end on 0xbfffffff.Like this : 

		-----	0xbfffffff
		Stack
		-----


		-----
		Code/
		Data
		-----	0x80480000

		When a process starting,linux put these messages in process space : 

		1>	The number of command-line parameters.
		2>	The process name finish from shell.
		3>	The parameters from command-lins.
		4>	The enviornment variables.

		Then the process space like this :	(General layout) 

		-----------	--->	Stack
		Env-variable
		-----------
		Env-pointer
		-----------
		0x00000000
		-----------
		pointer->cmdL-parameter3
		-----------
		pointer->cmdL-parameter2
		-----------
		pointer->cmdL-parameter1
		-----------
		proc-Name
		-----------
		Arguments num
		-----------	<---	ESP

		-----------

		Unmap		
	
		-----------
		.data
		-----------
		.bss
		-----------
		.text
		-----------

		
		So,could use stack to get command line parameters in the program.In the 32bit model,all of the command line parameters and the envs as same
	size is 4B,but in 64bit model,they are 8B.	(32bit--4B/Unit,64bit--8B/Unit)

Assembly Library : 

		The assembly-lib is that archiving some function-object-files as a library file.Static library : *.s,dynamic library : *.so.
	
		Files archiving like to C library building,but using assembly function in C program,must compling with some constraint : 

		The registers'usage in C program : 

		Registers			Status

		EAX				Save the output value,but this value may be changed before function return.
		EBX				Point to the global displacement table(Must retain it).
		ECX				Could using in function.	# But in cycle part,this register was possible used. Becareful.
		EDX				Could using in function.
		EBP				This Register would used as the Stack'Base_Pointer(Must retain it).
		ESP				Stack-TOP-Pointer.	
						# Some function would changed this register make it point at the last argument or local variable.
						# If not in that situation,inline ASM "push"/"pop" would be possible cause some error. Becareful.

		EDI				As a local register in C program.
		ESI				As a local register in C program.
						# GCC propobly use them to send arguments to function.
	
		ST(0)				Save the output value which type is floating data,but this value may be changed before function return.
		ST(1)~ST(7)			Could using in function.

		//	This is 32bit model C program register usage,but on 64bit model,R8~R15 registers would be using(Pay a notice).

		So,if you want to use assembly library in C program,must attend this constraint.At first determine the temporarly to be used registers,and 
	then save the old values,before return restore them.

		The C program sends parameters the order is right to left : _func_(a,b,c);
			#	First push 'c' to stack.
			#	Second push 'b' to stack.
			#	Third push 'a' to stack.
			#	.....

			#	Then ESP->'a'.

		Stack : 

			----------
			Other
			----------
			Parameter3	<-- 'c'
			----------
			Parameter2	<-- 'b'
			----------
			Parameter1	<-- 'a'
			----------
		ESP->	EIP		<-- By 'call'
			----------


		###


		For a string to be returned : 
			
			#	Remember that use Assembly function to processing string operation,must as a '\0' as end in the C/C++ program.

			In general situation,C program assume that the function return an integer value.But processing operation for string,must return a 
		pointer.For indication that the assembly function return a pointer,must adding a function prototype over the 'main' function.
			Like this : 

			char* _Asm_Func_(void);

			int main(void)
			{
				char* A=_Asm_Func_();
				...
			}

			The function'definition in the assembly object,so have not to define this function in this C program.

		###

		For a floating data to be returned : 
			
			The C program use the ST(0)-Register for switching floating value between in the functions.Function put a float ing value in the FPU
		Stack,and then return.The caller function pop that floating value up and assign it to a variable.

			Of cause,return a floating value must declare the Function'Prototype before the 'main' function.

			float _Asm_Func_(void);

			int main(void)
			{
				float A=_Asm_Func_();
				...
			}

			#	The floating data types have 'float' and 'double'.

		###

		For several kinds input parameters : 

			For example : An assembly function _Func_,it receive two for input arguments.The first is a double,the second is a int.
			
			Stack : 

				-------
				Other
				-------
				int	<--	4Bytes
				-------
				double	<--	8Bytes
				-------
			ESP->	IP
				-------

			_Func_ use 16(%EBP) to read the 8Bytes double value,use 24(%EBP) to read the 4Bytes int.
			If C program call this function as this style : 

				double a=3.11;
				int b=2;
				_Func_(b,a);

			And then,the 'b' is  a int value,it would be as the parameter1 put into the Stack._Func_ use 16(%EBP) to read a 8Byte data,but this 
		is a error.

				So must compling with the _Func_'rule to send parameters.Like this : 

					_Func_(a,b);	//	-----	
							//	b
				This's right.		//	-----
							//	a
				Right to Left push.	//	-----
							//	IP	<-- ESP
							//	-----

		###

		For using Assembly functions in C++ : 

			The default situation in C++,all function use the C++ 'Name and Call constraint' to translating.C++ function support to the overload,
		but C function do not support to overload.If you want use Assembly Function in C++ must adding the part :

			extern "C" {

				Function-Prototypes
				...
			}

			This part told to  the translater that these functions all are 'The C functions'.Then translater use the C method to translate these.

		###

		Create Assembly static library : 

			Like C static library'create-method.Translated the Assembly-Function files to the object files.Then use 'ar' tool to archiving these 
		files.
			gcc use option '-Wl,-Basic -lxx' could link the 'xx' library with static method.'-static' option will prevent all dynamic linking,so
		don't suggest that.Option '-static-libxx' could use static method to link some system library,but only support to the system libraries.

		###

		Create Assembly share library : 
			
			Like C share library'create-method.Use gcc'option '-share' to make a share libary.But before that must use the 'as' to translating 
		the source files to object files.
			Dynamic loader must had knew the share library path.Can use the two for methods to told it : 

			1>	The environment variable : LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
			2>	The ld.so.conf file.(After revised it,use command 'ldconf' to reload)

		---

---

System Call :

		All the system-call functions in the file '/usr/include/asm/unistd.h',the be supported calls all recorded in that file.
	
		The System call style : 

			1>	System-Call number.
			2>	System-Call input parameters.
			3>	System-Call return value.
			4>	The complex return value by System-Call.

		System-Call Number>

			Linux system use EAX register to save the System-Call-Number.The numbers were recorded in the '/usr/include/asm/unistd.h'

		System-Call Input Parameters>

			The general situation like this style :

				EBX	<--	Parameter 1.
				ECX	<--	Parameter 2.
				EDX	<--	Parameter 3.
				ESI	<--	Parameter 4.
				EDI	<--	Parameter 5.

			If the number of arguments greater than five,use the 'EBX' register to save a header pointer of the continuous memory unit.Input 
		parameters would saved in the units with continuous method.System use this 'EBX' register to accessing these parameters.

			System-Call-Functions'description could use 'man' pager to reading them.

		System-Call Return Value>

			The general situation value by system-call returned would saved in the EAX register.

		The Complex Return Value By System-Call>

			The complex return like 'return a struct' or 'return a class' or others.
			Could return a pointer,and then caller as the struct definition to read data(C program).
			In assembly program,coder could define a piece of memory to split it as a struct distribution.Define it in the '.data' section.

			Like this : 
				
			.section .data
			STRUCT_1:
				.Member1:
					.int 0			#	A int data.
				.Member2:
					.float 0		#	A floating data.
				.Member3:
					.ascii "00000000"	#	8Bytes array. char
			##

			Use 'STRUCT_1' as the struction'memory-block-symbol.
			Use '.Member1' as the first member'memory-block-symbol.
			Use '.Member2' as the second member'memory-block-symbol.
			Use '.Member3' as the third member'memory-block-symbol.

			If the System-Call return a struction,you must knew the struct definition at first.

Inline Assembly : 


		GNU/GCC Inline Assembly Style :

			asm("assembly code");		//	asm keywork to told translater there is a assembly code block.	

		The registers'name must is below style,like this : eax,ebx,ecx,edx,... ; Error : EAX,EBX,ECX,EDX,... ;
		(Only in *.c or *.cpp file)

		The constraint : 
	
			#	Assembly code must be contained in the ".."
			#	If assembly codes not one statement,must use newline 'character' to split them.('\n')
			#	Could use Tab character to indentate it.

		For example : 

			asm("movl %EBX,%EAX\n\t"
				"addl	%EAX,%ECX\n\t"
				...
			);

		Assembly code block could put in the C/C++ Source file anywhere.

		#	Using C global variable in assembly code block>

			Attention : Can not using the local variable in the basic assembly code block !!!

			For example :
			
			int a=12;
			int b=13;

			int main(void)
			{
				asm(
					"movl	a,%EAX \n\t"		//	'a' is a global variable symbol
					"movl	b,%EBX \n\t"		//	'b' also is a global variable symbol
					"addl	%EBX,%EAX \n\t"
				);
			}

			###

		#	Tell to translater that don't optimization for assembly code block>

			Use C/C++ modifier 'volatile',like this :

				asm volatile (assembly code);

			###

		#	For C/C++ keyword 'asm'>
		
			The C/C++ is possible to use the 'asm' as other features.If at that situation,could use '__asm__' keyword to switching with 'asm'.

			'__asm__' could be modified by '_volatile_' modifier.

			###

		#	Extra asm>

			Because the extended 'asm' would supported to other features,so must use a new style to coding : 

			asm("assmbly code" : output locations : input operands : changed registers);

			1>	assembly code block : The normaly asm syntax assembly code.
			2>	output locations : Contained Registers and Memory location list of Inline ASM'output.
			3>	input operands : Contained Registers and Memory location list of Inline ASM'input.
			4>	changed registers : List contained the was changed registers by Inline ASM. 
	
			#	Need not use all parts,but still use ':' as spliting.

			#	The extended ASM could use the local variable or the global variable !!

			!	Appoint the input value and the output value>

				In the extended ASM could assign input-value and output-value from registers or memory location.

				#	"constraint"(variable)

				variabel -> The variable in the C/C++ code.
				constraint -> Define that where the input to save or where the output to send.

				constraint is some characters.

				constraint TABLE :

				constraint 				Description

				a					Use %EAX or %AX or %AL
				b					Use %EBX or %BX or %BL
				c					Use %ECX or %CX or %CL
				d					Use %EDX or %DX or %DL
				S					Use %ESI or %SI
				D					Use %EDI or %DI
				r					Use anyone of the normaly registers
				q					Use %EAX or %EBX or %ECX or %EDX
				A					For 64bit data use %EAX and %EDX (Below and Hight)
				f					Use float register
				t					Use the float register which on the TOP	(The first)
				u					Use the second float register
				m					Use memory location of the variable
				o					Use the displacement of memory location
				V					Only use the directly memory location
				i					Use immediatly integer
				n					Use the immediatly integer which the value has been knew
				g					Use anything of the memory location or the registers all are could be used.
				
				#	Output modifier,tell translater that how processing the output value.

				+					Can I/O for operand
				=					Only_Read for operand
				%					If it is must,the operand could switching with the next operand
				&					Before the ASM completed,can deleting or reusing for operand

				Like this : 
					asm("assembly code" : "=a"(result) : "d"(data1),"c"(data2));

				And want to using register in the Extended ASM,must adding a '%' at the front :

				int maint(void) 
				{
					int result=0;	//	Local variable,auto variable
					int data1=1;
					int data2=2;

					asm("imull	%%EDX,%ECX\n\t"
						"movl	%%ECX,%%EAX\n\t"
						: "=a"(result)
						: "d"(data1),"c"(data2));
					
						//	Using auto variable in the Extended ASM.
					...	
				}

			###

			!	Use Placeholder>

				For the situation in several input or output values,Extended ASM provides 'Placeholder' be used in Inline ASM.

				For example : 
					
				int main(void)
				{
					int result=0;
					int data1=1;
					int data2=2;

					asm(
						"imull	%1,%2\n\t"
						"movl	%2,%0"
						: "=r"(result)
						: "r"(data1),"r"(data2));					
					...
				}
		
				#	Making the palceholders with order left to rigt 0,1,2,3,...

				#	%0 -> result
				#	%1 -> data1
				#	%2 -> data2

			###

			!	Cite Placeholder>

				If the Inline ASM,input and output use the same variable,can assign constraint value with a 'PlaceHolder'.

				Like this : 

				int main(void)
				{
					int data1=1;
					int data2=2;
					
					asm(
						"imull	%1,%0"
						: "=r"(data2)			//	Output data2 <-- 0
						: "r"(data1),"0"(data2));	//	Input data1 <-- 1
					...
				}

				#	In this exampling,"0" tell translater that use the output register "r"0-->data2 as an input value register.

			###

			!	Switching Placeholder with a Name>

				Syntax : %[name] "constraint"(variable)		//	Was supported over the version GNU/GCC 3.1

				Like this : 

				int main(void)
				{
					int data1=1;
					int data2=2;
				
					asm(
						"imull	%[Value1],%[Value2]"
						: %[Value2] "r="(data2)
						: %[Value1] "r"(data1),"0"(data2)):
					...
				}

				Use the 'Value1' and the 'Value2' to switching placeholders.

			###

			!	Changed registers list>

				This feature can only be using at the translater don't know that which register changed.
				If Inline ASM used the input value registers and the output value registers they are not be initialized,must tell translater
			that which registers would be changed.

				Like this : 
			
				int main(void)
				{

					int data1=1;	
					int data2=2;
					int result=0;
				
					asm(
						"movl	%1,%%EAX\n\t"
						"addl	%%EAX,%0"		//	Use EAX as input register,but in input-part not have this register.
						: "=r"(result)
						: "r"(data1),"0"(result)
						: "%EAX"			//	So there tell translater that the EAX changed.
					);					//	Then assembler will prevent to use this EAX register.
					...
				}

				Attention : 
						If used anyone of memory address in Extended ASM and they were not defined in the I/O parts,it must be marked
				to broken.Use "memory' to tell translater that the memory address had been changed in Inline ASM.
		
			###

			!	Assembly macro>

				The assembly macro like the C macro-function : 

				#define KKSK(i,k,s) ((s)=(i)+(k))	//	C macro function

				#define _KKSK_(result,data1,data2) ({\
							asm(\
								"movl	%1,%%EAX\n\t" \
								"movl	%2,%%EDX\n\t" \
								"addl	%1,%2\n\t" \
								"movl	%2,%0\n\t" \
								: "=r"(result) \		//	0-->result
								: "r"(data1),"r"(data2) \	//	1-->data1,2-->data2
							);\
							})
